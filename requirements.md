# General Instructions

## Overview

In this staff graded assignment you will submit your final project report. The report will consist of six chapters:

1. **Introduction:** this will explain the project concept and motivation for the project, and **must** also state which project template you are using. Please include the project number in the way it has been listed in the template. (max 1000 words)
2. **Literature review:** this is a revised version of the chapter from your draft report, to include any further work you may have done since then, and to incorporate the feedback you have obtained from your submissions. (max 2500 words)
3. **Design:** this is a revised version of the relevant chapter from your draft report, again incorporating appropriate feedback and any changes you may have made to your design based on feedback given on previous submissions. (max 2000 words)
4. **Implementation:** this should describe the implementation of the project. This should follow the style of the topic 6 peer review (but greatly expanded to cover the entire implementation), describing the major algorithms/techniques used, explanation of the most important parts of the code and a visual representation of the results (e.g. screenshots or graphs). (max 2500 words)
5. **Evaluation:** Describe the evaluation carried out (e.g. user studies or testing on data) and give the results. You should also justify your choices in your approach to obtaining and analysing the results. Your evaluation should give a critique of the project as a whole, highlighting successes, failures, limitations and possible extensions. (max 2500 words)
6. **Conclusion:** This can be a short summary of the project as a whole but, it can also bring out any broader themes you would like to discuss, or suggest further work. (max 1000 words)

**Total word max: 10,500** (NOTE that if you add up all of the above, this comes to more than 10,500 words. 10,500 words is a strict limit, and each of the section limits are strict, but this approach allows you to exercise some flexibility in the spread of your writing across the different sections, to suit your particular project).  
**Submissions that exceed this strict word limit will be penalised.**

- In addition to the limits listed, you can have additional pages of images and references. Your list of references, table and figure legends, and the titles of chapters are not included in the word limits.
- You must include a link to your code repository, which needs to be publicly viewable at the time of your submission, and remain viewable until you have received your results.
- You can return to the previous peer reviews for instructions on the first four parts of this submission, as well as the instructions of the submission of your draft report.
- As well as the report you **must** submit a 3–5 minute video demonstrating your project working. The content of the video will vary depending on your actual project, but it should show all the important features of the project and explain a little of how they work or justify the approaches taken. Videos that do not show a working project will receive significantly lower marks. You should also include appropriate visuals for your video.
- Your video does not need to show you visually (though it may, if you feel this is the best way to convey impact), but it must contain audio, with the descriptions and explanations spoken by you. **No AI generated voices are to be used; videos are not to be speeded up. Videos that are outwith the length or other constraints given here will be penalised.**

## IMPORTANT

For each chapter, state the word count of that chapter as part of the chapter title.  For example:
1. Introduction (783/1000 words)

## Review Criteria

Your work will be marked according to the following criteria as well as the ones pertaining to your earlier submissions.

1. Is the report clearly written and presented?
2. Are the diagrams and images appropriate and clear?
3. Does the report display knowledge of the area of study, previous work and academic literature?
4. Does the report critically evaluate the previous work and/or academic literature?
5. Does the report use proper citation and referencing?
6. Is the design of the project clear and of high quality?
7. Is the project concept justified based on the domain and users?
8. Is the final implementation of high quality, and is it described well?
9. Is the final implementation technically challenging?
10. Is the evaluation strategy appropriate to the aims of the project?
11. Does the evaluation display good coverage of appropriate issues?
12. Are the results of the evaluation presented well?
13. Are the evaluation results used to critically analyse the project with respect to the aims and objectives of the project?
14. Are there appropriate conclusions drawn, and is there appropriate concluding discussion?
15. Is the overall quality of the discussion strong, with justification of claims and justification of decisions?
16. Does the project display evidence of originality?
17. Is there an appropriate video that demonstrates the working program, the achievements, and the understanding gained?
18. Is the video well thought through, well structured, and impactful?


# Chapter Specific Instructions
## Literature Review
You should submit a draft literature survey for your project. This should be a document covering at least 4-6 examples of previous work or academic literature. 

Examples of types of literature you might want to include:
- Examples of projects that are similar to your own (these can be the same as those used in your proposal).
- Techniques and methods that you plan to use. These could be software libraries, algorithms, or research methodologies. 
- Research studies that show the effectiveness of the project you intend to create (for example, if you are doing a project on educational technology, a psychological or educational study showing that the techniques you are using are effective for teaching). 

This literature can include academic papers and books. It can also include online articles and websites, but in that case,  you should also explain why you consider them credible sources. 

You should evaluate the literature and explain how it contributes to your project, or how it demonstrates the gaps that your project intends to fill. 

The report should be in PDF format, up to 6 pages (minimum font size 11pt, minimum margin 2cm). There is a word limit in the summative assessments of 2500 words for your literature review, so it is a good idea to try to keep within this limit. You may include additional pages of images and citations. 

You should, if appropriate, use visual materials, for example, images and diagrams from the literature you are citing. If you do include such items, you also must cite them appropriately. You might also want to include tables that compare different examples of prior work. 

Note that a good literature review is more than just a serial summary of the items you’ve chosen to present. Drawing similarities, identifying differing views, contrasting, etc., is the added value that a high quality review provides to the reader. This aspect is what makes a review pertinent to your particular topic and the focus you are taking for it.

All work discussed should be [properly cited and referenced](https://onlinelibrary.london.ac.uk/support/referencing).

You will be marked according to the following criteria:
- Does the report display knowledge of the area of study, previous work and academic literature?
- Does the report critically evaluate the previous work and/or academic literature?
- Does the report use proper citation and referencing?
- Does the report add value beyond summarising the different work coherently?

## Design

In this assignment you will submit a design for this project. 

- Explain the domain and users of the project. Who is the project for? What is the domain of the project (e.g. music game, history education, therapy for phobias, narrative films)?
- Justify your design choices based on the needs of users/the requirements of the domain
- The overall structure of the project (for example, this could be the architecture of a software project, the story of a VR project, the visual interface of a mobile app or the research question and methods of a data science project)
- Identification of the most important technologies and methods you will be using in the project
- A plan of your work. This should include the major tasks and when you will do them laid out visually (for example in a Gantt chart)
- A concrete plan for how you will test and evaluate your project. This should include your approach to deciding whether the project has achieved what you set out to do.
- The proposal should take the form of a PDF document  (minimum font 12pt, minimum margins 2cm). There is a word limit in the summative assessments of 2000 words for your design section, so it is a good idea to try to keep within this limit. You can have additional pages of images or references that do not contribute to the word count.

You will be marked according to the following criteria:

- Is the design of the project clear and of high quality?
- Is the project concept justified based on the domain and users?
- Is the workplan explained in enough detail?
- Is the workplan feasible?
- Are there contingency plans?
- Is the evaluation approach sufficiently comprehensive?
- Is the evaluation strategy appropriate to the aims of the project?
