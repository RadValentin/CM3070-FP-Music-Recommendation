# Music Recommendation System Prototype

As a placeholder for the final dataset, I used the ["Spotify Million Song Dataset"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset) licensed under [CC0: Public Domain](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) from Kaggle.

Prototype user flow:
- User finds the song he likes using the front-end
  - Back-end should support searching for songs by title, returning matches with their IDs
- Dataset is loaded, a machine learning model is trained on it

For 57650 songs it takes 2,85 GB of disk space to store their associated TFIDF vectors. This is a noticeable increase in storage requirements as the lyrics themselves only take up 71 MB.

Some insights on the vectors themselves:
- Each has a 10k features upper bound
- They're sparsely populated, most values being zero
- They're stored in the DB as raw JSON which will involve some overhead when accessing and processing them
